              <ol>
                <li>Heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the pancetta and
                   cook until rendered and crispy, about 5 to 7 minutes
                </li>
                <li>Transfer the pancetta to a plate covered with a psper towel
                   and set aside, leaving any rendered fat behind in the pan
                </li>
                <li>Add the onion, red pepper flakes, and a generous pinch of salt
                   to the pan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring often, until the onions
                    are soft, translucent, and just beginning to gain color, about 5 to 7 minutes
                </li>
                <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, stirring constantly,
                   about 1 to 2 minutes
                </li>
                <li>Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly to prevent
                   scorching, until the tomato paste has started to cook slightly
                    and darken in color
                </li>
                <li>Add the canned tomatoes </li>
                <li>Add reserved crispy pancetta back into the pan and stir the
                   sauce until all of the ingredients are incorporated evenly
                </li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for an additional 15 to 20 minutes,
                   seasoning to taste with salt and black pepper
                </li>
                <li>With the pan over low heat, add the pecorino cheese</li>
                <li>Serve with additional finely grated pecorino as desired</li>
                <li>Serve with Bucatini or Rigatoni pasta or some fresh crusty bread</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Note: If you are making pasta, add a generous splash or two of starchy
                 pasta water as needed to help loosen the sauce after you have
                  added the pecorino in step 9
